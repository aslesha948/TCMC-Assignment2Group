<h3>Project Review</h3>
<p><b>Pluses:</b> The contents which have put in the website is easily understandable and navigated properly, any person can easily go through the website by looking at the home page.  <br>
	<b>Minuses:</b> We consumed most of the time by arranging the content for each page. We have tested each and every page before combining. We haven't got the action.php document properly even after referring so many tutorials. <br>
	<b>Interesting: </b> The best part is we have used Bootstrap css file, which allowed to align the content accordingly (referring to HOME PAGE). We have even learnt various type of arrangements and tested each and every document. We had a great experience working together which led us to present a proper and formal of web site.
